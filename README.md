## Description

Horiseon is a social media marketing website that I was asked to refactor to make it accessible and more efficient. This was the Challenge 01 homework assignment for the Full-stack Software Devleopment Bootcamp I was enrolled in through Arizona State University (ASU). The assignment was to refactor the code to make it accessible while eliminating any unnecessary code. 

I changed all the non-semantic elements to semantic elements and updated the css to match the semantic html elements. I put some of the code in a slightly more logical order and condensed some of the repetitive code into a much shorter, more efficient code. There were no alt attributes on any of the photos or images, so I added a different alt attribute to all seven of them. I also updated the title in the html to more accurately reflect what the website is for. Lastly, I added comments in both the html and css to show the company or client what code I changed, exactly where I made the changes, and why I made those changes.
